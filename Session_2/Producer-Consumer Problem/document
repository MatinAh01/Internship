Code Challenge: Producer-Consumer Problem
Problem Statement
Implement a Producer-Consumer scenario using multithreading in C#. The goal is to simulate a system where:

1-Producers generate data and add it to a shared buffer (queue).

2-Consumers remove data from the buffer and process it.

3-The buffer has a limited capacity (e.g., 10 items). If the buffer is full, producers must wait until space is available. If the buffer is empty, consumers must wait until data is available.
